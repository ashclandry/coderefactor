# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description
This purpose of this repository is to edit a starter code provided to meet accessibility standards for search engine optimization. 

There were multiple steps taken to make this webpage more accessible for my clients' audience. Starting from the title of the webpage (which appears as the tab description in your browser), this was renamed to "Horiseon Home Page" to describe what the viewer would be looking at when they clicked on the URL for this webpage. 

Next, in the website's header, the "seo" span element within the Horiseon now appears more visible to the viewer after changing the color to contrast more with the background. 

After that, the proper id was added to the "search engine optimization" link so that when the user clicks on the button, it will bring them to the correct content section for that link. 

Finally, all of the pictures displayed in the main section, as well as the aside column of the webpage, have alt attributes that adequately describe what the image is showing in case of page breaks and for accessibility purposes.

## Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
